# Electricpe_Business_Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive business analytics case study on ElectricPe, focused on improving sales efficiency, operational performance, and customer experience across the EV ecosystem.
Through detailed analysis of lead management, delivery turnaround time (TAT), and customer feedback data, the project uncovers a critical insight: while lead conversion rates are strong at the top of the funnel, operational gaps and weak post-sales engagement are driving major customer dissatisfaction.

Key problem areas identified include:

1. High percentage of leads turning “cold” after initial contact
2. Delivery delays varying across locations
3. Poor follow-up tracking and lack of structured cancellation insights
4. Critically low Net Promoter Score (NPS), signaling severe trust erosion

Based on these insights, the project proposes data-backed, actionable recommendations, including automated lead re-engagement workflows, standardized delivery SLAs, mandatory service follow-ups, and a closed-loop customer feedback system.

Business Impact (Expected)

1. Improved conversions through effective cold-lead activation
2. Faster deliveries with consistent operational standards
3. Significant uplift in customer satisfaction and brand trust

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in business analysis, problem structuring, KPI evaluation, and translating data into strategic decisions, making it highly relevant for roles in analytics, consulting, and operations strategy.
